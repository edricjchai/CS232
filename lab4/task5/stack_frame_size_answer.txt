For the recursive function, each time it is called it should create a new stack frame for the variables. Therefore the recursive function
has to be counted in number of stack frames. Each call also takes up memory so the size of the stack frames would be counted based on
how much memory the computer running the code has. Also explaining why there is a segmentation fault, because the call is trying to pull
memory where there is no memory left because it has been all taken up by the recursive call.
